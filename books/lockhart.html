    <h2>E.Lockhart</h2>
    <p>
      "We Were Liars" by E. Lockhart is a gripping young adult novel about a wealthy family's dark secrets and a
      devastating tragedy that the protagonist, Cadence Sinclair Eastman, struggles to remember. The novel is a powerful
      exploration of the effects of trauma and family dysfunction, and the unreliable narrator keeps readers on the edge
      of their seat until the very end.
