      This is a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing it—for good.Coexisting but
      conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel
      completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional
      intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and
      learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential.For
      centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem
      impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating
      trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb.In the end, it is not the mountain we
      master, but ourselves.
